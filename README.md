# TIIGER TLS

A small-footprint clean-room implementation of TLS1.3 in C++ and Rust. The C++ version provides only a client, but is particularly well suited
for constrained environments. The Rust version provides both a client and a server. 

Note that these implementations are particularly suited for testing Post-Quantum alternatives to current standard cryptographic primitives.
